# MiSTer Kun - Konichimeow!

I wanted to cut a vinyl decal of the mascot for the MiSTer FPGA project, but couldn't find a clean copy on the web.  So I decided to use the favicon and the low-res sample I found on Google Image Search and decided to remaster it for everyone to use.  Rather than submit this directly to the MiSTer GitHub repository, I decided to host it as its own project for people to use as they see fit.

Current Files
- Full Color: this version is the closest to what the favicon and low-res artwork look like.  I made an executive decision to reduce the color palette by one color to promote uniformity.
- Grayscale: replaces the pink with gray or white for when use of color is not available.
- Black & White: gets rid of all shades of gray.  I'm planning on using this as a basis for a 3D STL file for people to use for 3D printing allowing for a filament color swap in the middle.
- Vinyl Inverted and Sample: In order to cut MiSTer Kun in Vinyl, I inverted the design and added a white outline to make it look great on a tinted window.
