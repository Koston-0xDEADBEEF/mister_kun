# MiSTer Kun

I wanted to cut a vinyl decal of the mascot for the MiSTer FPGA project, but couldn't find a clean copy on the web.  So I decided to use the favicon and the low-res sample I found on Google Image Search and decided to remaster it for everyone to use.  Rather than submit this directly to the MiSTer GitHub repository, I decided to host it as its own project for people to use as they see fit.
