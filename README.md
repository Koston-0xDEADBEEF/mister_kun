# MiSTer Kun - Konichimeow!

**Current Files**
- **Full Color:** this version is the closest to what the favicon and low-res artwork look like.  I made an executive decision to reduce the color palette by one color to promote uniformity.
- **Grayscale:** replaces the pink with gray or white for when use of color is not available.
- **Black & White:** gets rid of all shades of gray.  
- **Vinyl Inverted and Sample:** In order to cut MiSTer Kun in Vinyl, I inverted the design and added a white outline to make it look great on a tinted window.
- **Combined Logo & Mascot:** The mascot has been combined with the artwork provided by Javier Rodas on the MiSTer Facebook page.  For these versions, I brought in some of the color from MiSTer Kun's palette to bring some unity to the designs.
- **Project Art:** Since GitHub allows for a project file for social media and whatnot, I decided to create one.
- **Comparison of Logo Font to Open Sans Extra Bold Italic:** While it's not a perfect match, a case can be made that it's a reasonable match. At bare minimum it can serve as a decent substitute.
- **3D Emblem:** A 3D STL file for people to use for 3D printing.  If you want a 2 color effect like the original, start with a white filament and swap to a black filament at 33-34 percent.
- **8-Bit:** Created a sprite version by downscaling the original and drawing it out in pixel format.  There are full-color, grayscale, black & white and STL files available.
