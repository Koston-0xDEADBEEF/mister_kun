The MiSTer-Kun mascot was originally created by GitHub user "HeWhoisRed" for the MiSTer FPGA Project and the design is considered a gift to the MiSTer community. The intention is for the mascot to be used/remixed/whatever'd as people wish. A simple accreditation is appreciated when it is possible and appropriate.

The icons and logos in the MiSTer-Kun GitHub Repository are remastered versions of the mascot that adhere to the above license terms. Thanks for GitHub user "HeWhoisRed" who created the original design.
